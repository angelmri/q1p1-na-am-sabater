                    <p>
                        Our data is the sample size of the top 12 movies in terms of box office sales, released from year 2018 - 2023. Our qualitative variables include the gross sales these movies made in the worldwide box office, and the production budget of these movies, in US Dollars. Our qualitative variables are the genre, distribution company of these movies, and the year these movies were released.
                        The following graphs and tables are the analysis of these variables.

                            The histogram and FDT accounts for 66 of the 72 movies that were originally listed. This was due to some movies, specifically those
                            made in China, not having a public/disclosed production budget. Out of the 66 production budgets available, 48, or about 72.73%, of them 
                            had a budget between the range $72,630,383.50-$243,271,535.50.

                            Through research, we uncovered a range in box office sales, with most movies falling between $198,921,658.50 and $1,174,115,701.50. 
                            Additionally, approximately 48 films in our dataset had budgets ranging from $72,630,383.50 to $243,271,535.50.

                            <br><br>
                            Our analysis also spotlighted Walt Disney as a dominant force in the cinematic realm. 
                            Not only did the company produce about 30% of the movies in the Top 12 from 2018 to 2023, 
                            but it also commands the highest total production budget of $976,400,000.00. 
                            <br><br>
                            Furthermore, we unraveled intriguing insights within the genre category. 
                            The Action genre emerges as the most plenteous, reflecting its enduring popularity among audiences. 
                            Even so, it's the Superhero genre that takes the crown in terms of box office revenue. 
                            This revelation hints at the enduring appeal and profitability of larger-than-life, hero-driven narratives.
                            <br><br>
                            In conclusion, our analysis illuminates the multifaceted nature of the film industry. 
                            It reminds us that success is a product of numerous variables, from production budgets to genre preferences. 
                            While these findings provide valuable insights, they should be viewed as a snapshot in an ever-evolving cinematic landscape. 
                            As the industry continues to evolve, so too will the factors influencing the success of our favorite films.
